"Vivo y21l is a product of India. It is really a good phone. It is a budget phone with amazing features. Many sensors are given in this phone to make the users more attracted to this phone. Battery life is also satisfactory. Talking about camera, you can take many photos in a short period also. This is really a good and portable phone if you're going for a picnic or even a long drive. Thanks to its looks and sound quality. The only drawback of this phone is that it gets heated if used continuously. Besides that, I personally love this phone. And I recommend you to buy this phone to get the best value of your money. Thanks ??Hello friend's my name is mandeep singh. Today I goona to review the vivo y21l mobile.It is a waste product.But it is light weight compare other mobile.Its camra is very bad.Its bettary backup is only one day.But its screen very hard. On internet connection bettary is bring down in 4 hours.And its price is very.I can recommend you not buy this mobile.Its waste products.You can buy other mobile of vivo.But it is include in many feature.These features can make this mobile is awesome but I recommend you to not buy this mobile.Its speaker is good
Vivo y21l is a best mobile in low price and good quality. It has 1 GB ram. 32GB internal memory. It has 5 Mega pixel camera in back and 2.0 something Mega pixel in front camera. Battery Mah is 2000. It has otg system. It is Android version mobile.it is 4g volte mobile .dual sim card. It's a good mobile. I like this.
Now I am going to give my view on the VIVO Y21 moblile.I bought this mobile about one and half year ago and it was my big mistaketo buy this mobile. after using this look it is really having a very attractive look and it provides a good feature as any other mobile but pocess is little glpw.
As the processor is very slow it takes a lot of time to open the application in this mobile. and looks a little less quality mobile.When it comes to the battery it has 2000 mah battery due to which the battery backup of about 3-4 hrs only which is very less and the charging time of this mobile is about 3-4 hrs of charging time, if one has to use the mobile then one has to charge the mobile about 2-3 times a day which requires a large time. If a user need to run the mobile he has to charge every now and then and use and in travelling this mobile cannot be used as it may turnoff ant time due to less battery.
All other things are good in this mobile but battery problem is one of the biggest problem which the users wants to run the mobile and needs the battery backup of about 7-8 hrs which other mobile companies are providing at this rate.
Hello friend I want to tell about the phone vivo Y21L this phone is very smart and good looking model the version of the phone is 5.1.1and I have no need for SD card Because the phone have ability to store many types of media like photos songs HD videos movies. But there is one problem the battey storage is short that means charger time one day
One of my ralavite sold this phone to me but when he sold it was new only . And I have used it for 4 weeks but felt disapointed about this phone the cost of this phone is 7490RS when I took it. Really its not worthy for this phone.Beacuse in 7K we can buy good featured phone which comes with marshmallow version and it is run with Android 5.1 lollipop version which is less for this phone price.The major problem what I faced with this phone is battery package. this phone battery not last for one day if u r into internet or games it has only 2000mah battery.If I use much data the phone used to get hang and it would take to onother web page which was disgusting while using the phone.so if your looking good phone under 7K this is not the one.
Hi im prasad im sharing my personal experience on the mobile vivo Y21L this mobile is working slow I have recently brought before 6 months and so many problems im facing the mobile is heating when I use it for 1 to 2 hours continuesly and the sound quality of this mobile is very low and its hanging when im doing some work or playing games it strucks so that we have to reebot the mobile and the rear camera is not good and secondary camera is also poor and the main thing battery backup is only 4 hours im unsatisfied with this phone simply waste of money

This product is not good at all firstly made in China. Display quality is very bad small screen size low resolution. On sunlight it is unable to look on the screen. Calling takes a lot of time to connect and reception is also very poor network seems nil most of the time.battery backup is of 2-3 hours while doing internet. Camera is the most worst part of this product. It even fails to capture a distant object. Storage is very low and unbalanced 1gb 16gb is not the good idea. That's why game is unplayable. Processor is very outdated
I'm brought this vivo y21L phone. I am not an regular Customer of vivo phone. I had brought this phone in just 6 months ago. I had no experienced in this phones. So, in my uncles requests I had purchased this phone from the vivo phones showroom. This phone was not so much decorated and attractive to the Mobile buyers.the features was just good but the other features was nothing to buy. This phone was got created many big problems that I have to faced it in many times. This phone had gave 1GB ram and 16 GB internal memory. It's good ok bt in most of the time after used of 50 memory it show that you had no space for downloaded files to save please removed some files from the file manager then got it. Nxt pints was it's camera quality was not high enough quality than Samsung, mottorela, mi and also other renowned phones had.in used of some few minutes this phone was so much heated that after it you didn't used it properly. But charger quality was very good you could charged it with just few minutes.it another good pints was if you wanted to chat with anyone like facebook, whatsapp, hike, messenger and massege also you could got typs very fast because it gaves you suppose you wanted to type - him then in it's screen it write this words.this was very short process for save times, in other most of the famous phone companies didn't gave any kind of opportunities that this phone gaves. Bt also after brought this phone I had to went vivo customer care for this phone 2 months. This phone was not satisfied me. Thanks for the review.

Best network. I suggest you to buy this brand. It is a best smartphone forever. Good sound quality. I like this smartphone too much.
To bad phone and over rated products of this brand . Phone are android and limited in functionality.They fully designed android skin to ios but they did not match their highly classified operating system ios. Vivo is an over rated brand and they did alot of advertisements of their phones in indian markets and people are used to but it, but they used phone with limilted time and buy it to olx and other online stores that sale refurbished products. Otherwise, it is not so good phone and users need to concontrate that avoid these to buy.customer service are not more in numbers. repairing need months .

And he told me this mobile 's battery backup is very low because 2000 mah battery of this phone. It is available in two colours white and grey and the weight of this mobile is 145 GM. The rear rear camera of this phone is 5 MP with the led flash and the selfie camera is 2 MP it has not good selfie. It is based on Android 5.1 lollipop and fun touch OS multi touch display.

But this Vivo Y21L Network phone not good and but good customer services this phone & this phone feature and function not different other Vivo phone and not nice Function this phone.

Hi, my todays review is on vivo Y21L which is a good phone .I bought this phone two months before on my wifes birthday. This phone is available for Rs 7000 in the market. This phone has lots of new features which are available in costly phones only. Its screen size is 4.5 inch with a resolution of 480* 854 pixels. The display of this phone is HD .This phone supports full hd videos. Real camera of this phone is 5 and front camera is 2 megapixels both of them are very good for taking photos and taking videos. I often use my wifes phone for video calling and it gives good quality. Its battery capacity is 2000 MAh it gives good backup you can enjoy music on it for several hours. Their is no network problem in this phone. The sound quality of this phone is superb. It has 1 gb of ram and 1.2 GHZ quad core snapdragon processor and it supports sd card upto 128 gb. It supports 4G network. One thing in vivo phones are that they do not hang at all.If anybody wants to buy phone in around 7000 rupees then they should buy this phone because it has all new features and also supports pendrive ( OTG) .It is available in white and grey colour. Design of this phone is also good and it is volte. I really love this phone very much .
Vivo Y21L Dual Sim, 4G, 3G, Wi-Fi and other feature which satisfy the customer.But Battery Problem in  Vivo Y21L  Discharge very fast 2-3 hours. if wifi is on continue 1-2 hours its battery become hot. Its prize also not fare compare to other mobile wich have same or more than Vivo Y21L features or specification. My suggestion is that please if anybody wants to buy the Vivo Y21L please think about battery problem and other feature and specification.
Recently I purchased Vivo Y21L for myself at Rs. 8,000 from local shop and after using it for two months I am so happy that I just needed to share my experience with you.
Y21L has a decent 16GB of ROM memory capacity, allowing us to download and try many apps, photos, songs, movies etc. associated with 1 GB RAM which provide very good speed for a normal user not using too many 3D video games on android. Its 4G LTE feature is also very good. What I like most is the imanager which provides inbulit options for app management, phone cleaner, data management etc for which we need not to install seperate apps.
Equipeed with dual sim, Wi-fi, Bluetooth, 3.5mm audio jack, and Micro-USB with USB OTG compatibility, Quad Core, 1.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 410(MSM8916) processor, 2000 mAH Battery, 4.5 inches, 480 x 854 pixel display, 5 MP rear Camera with flash, 2-megapixel front-facing camera, Memory Card Supported upto 128 GB, Android, v5.1 Lollipop are not only good but give immense satisfaction.
The smartphone has a 2000mAh battery with only 145 grams weight which make phone lightweight and easy to handle.
Unique features such as Palm Capture and Voice Capture are interesting although I don't use it now. .By voice capture we can click photo just by saying cheese.Other features include Smart Wake and Smart Click which are gesture shortcuts to improve customer experience.
Few days back its price is also dropped to approx INR 7500. Finally I would say this is very nice product below 8000 range, with a very smooth touchscreen which hardly hangs. Purchasing and using Vivo y21L has proven a wise decision to me.
Friends this is very bad mobile I am using this phone . But I am not satisfied with this phone
Because this ia not perfect phone .
Because this phones has lots problem with features and touch problem and softwear problem . Hardwear problem.
This phone was not working properly due its less ram it has only 1gb ram. And my phone giving lots of softwear problem. The problem is when data roaming activated it gets hang. And the big problem is about its battery backup. The battery backup is very poor nearly it works only 3hrs to 4hrs while you charge full . Finally plese do not buy this phone.
IM USING THIS MOBILE LAST 1.5 YEAR AND NOT FACING ANY SINGLE PROBLEM IT HAS BEST PERFORMANCE AND FAST SPEED SO IM SUGGESTING EVERYONE THAT IF THE HAVE NOT MORE BUDGET FOR BUYING HIGH RATED MOBILE THEN THEY CAN BUY THIS MOBILE IM SURE THAT THIS MOBILE IS BEST FOR FIRST TIME USE AND IM SURE THAT IF ANY ONE CAN USE VIVO MOBILE THEN DEFINETLY HE WILL PURCHASE NEXT TIME ONLY VIVO MOBILES NOT ANYOTHER MOBILE

I am bought this mobile 6 month ago.this mobile is really awesome. I bought this mobile because this phone is better than other this range mobile. Vivo y21 in this phone 1gb ram, 16gb rom and good quality camera. So it's awesome for mid range phones. This phone is working so smoothly .In vivo y21 a many interesting features like Smart wake.smart wake feature is awesome. Vivo y21 gaming capacity is Good. In the 1gb ram we run big game s in this phone. This mobile Storage is uge. 16gb memory is enough for anyone in this prize. And we talked about ita camera. This mobile camera is not awesome but good.and all over we see this is a best Android mobile for mid range.

I am using vivo y21L smartphone from two months. I fell that it was a good featuring smartphone. This vivo model have 2 MP front and 5 MP rear camera. The camera quality is very good. This smartphone have best hidden features than others. But the biggest problem of this smartphone is very bad battery backup. And also it hangs too much after some weeks.The ram of this smartphone is only one gb.
Excellent device great speed, enjoyed this device! Vivo Y21L is very low in price it but it works awesome, It have 1GB Ram but works better then 2GB Phones, Good Battery life , Nice camera, Nice quality of screen good quality speaker , Screenshot feature is really good, The phone takes 10-20 minutes to charge from 10 to 100 , satisfied with this cool device.

The vivo y21l mobile is much better mobile and 1gb ram , and8 gb rom, 8mp camera , the ram is very for the cost of mobe 6700 redmi 4ais best more than vivo y21l, rom is great 8gb, 4.5 inches display not good no bateery back up some better I im hating while using hanging problem want break the mobile but I have only one mobile , before u wany buy this mobile check the details and after buy it

I have been using the phone from last two months its pretty good talking about the look is quite stylish light weight love listening music but not satisfied purchasing at the price of Rs 7, 490. The phone gets heated while streaming video's for long time sometimes gets over heated while talking on the phone for long hours which brings a fear of getting blast and then you need to switch it off for a while until it gets cooled up, it also gets slow while working with the applications like facebook messenger, google chrome facebook etc which really disappoints.
Vivo is Worst company ever

Because I have vivo y51l

There is not respect of customer

When we call custmer care

And There is not onlune update

We need to go sevice center for software update and wasting time

In other way vivo is nice

But Not In gaming

All game are hanging in this phone hate hate hate hate hate hate big hate

Camera is not good

Company says camra phone

But camera quality is poor big hate

This phone is worth the extra money you pay when you compare it to others in this range. A user-friendly interface, to start with, puts on a little smile to your face. The network reception is amazing. One of the most helpful and unique features on this phone was the drop down search menu for the system and phone memory. Also, I personally found the phone pretty handy and conventional in terms of size. If you are for looking for just a smartphone, you might get a lot of them in this price range but Vivo Y21L strikes out of the ordinary, and the only way can discover that is by using it.
 I have bought this phone max before 4 months it is small phone who does 't work a much on internet good feature about phone good camera quality 4g mobile 5.0 lolipop but phone battery dwells up early it not a good phone for those want a good speed internet and who want big screen from my point of view not a good phone",Negative
